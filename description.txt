This mod lets you and others draw together in multiplayer, so you can annotate stuff, plan buildings, leave messages behind without needing a sign, clutter up the screen, or draw whatever else a typical gamer would together. You can write anywhere on the world. They're saved in the world file when you exit and save.
You can:
 - Draw in 9 different colors
 - Change brush size
 - Draw using any Terraria item sprite as your brush
 - Erase (your own and other's)

Keybinds to set:
 - Increase Brush Size
 - Decrease Brush Size
 - Resync
 - Erase nearby drawings (Singleplayer only)

Commands:
 - "/pen" to receive the pen item
 - "/setcolor [color]" where [color] is 'black', 'white', 'red', 'green', 'blue', or a valid item ID. Or you can type the item ID in the client side config for Brush Image.
 - "/hideUI" to hide the GUI

You may notice that in multiplayer, if you draw or erase for too long without releasing the mouse button, your drawing or erasing may be interrupted. This is intentional.

You can configure the smoothness in server settings. If there is performance issues, turning down the smoothness can help.
