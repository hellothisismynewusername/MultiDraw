This mod lets you and others draw together in multiplayer, so you can annotate stuff, plan buildings, leave messages behind without needing a sign, clutter up the screen, or draw whatever else a typical gamer would together. You can write anywhere on the world. They're saved in the world file when you exit and save.
You can:
 - Draw in 9 different colors
 - Change brush size
 - Draw using any Terraria item sprite (like using stamps)
 - Erase (your own or other's)
 - Craft the Pen item to draw, using 1 Dirt Block

You may notice that in multiplayer, if you draw or erase for too long without releasing the mouse button, your drawing or erasing may be interrupted. This is intentional.

To change color or set your brush to a Terraria item sprite, type in the chat "/setcolor [color]" where [color] is either 'black', 'white', 'red', 'green', 'blue', or a valid item ID.

Please set your keybinds for Increase brush size, Decrease brush size, and Re-sync.
You can configure the smoothness in server settings.

 - Fixed the previous update's first fix.

Update 1.1.1:

 - Fixed drawings disappearing, pressing Re-display after dying or teleporting is no longer needed.

Update 1.1.0:
 - Now saves drawings to the world!
 - Fixed a very rare bug related to the number of packets needed for sending the drawings from server to client.
 - Off-screen drawings don't render. This doesn't account for zoom.
